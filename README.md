## What is Deepfakes?

In December 2017, a user with name “DeepFakes” posted realistic looking videos of famous celebrities on Reddit. These fake videos are generated using deep learning, by swapping faces of original adult movies with celebrities’ faces. Since then, the topic of DeepFakes goes viral on internet.

Here, we denote DeepFakes as any fake contents generated by deep learning techniques. DeepFakes comes in different forms, perhaps the most typical ones are: 1) Videos and images, 2) Texts, and 3) Voices. Different deep learning techniques are used to generate DeepFakes. For instance, videos and images are usually created by Generative adversarial networks (GAN), while texts are mostly generated by deep language models based on Transformers.
